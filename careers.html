    <h3>About Us</h3>

    <p>
      Sparrow is a fast-growing software startup based in San Francisco. Our mission is to make it
      simple for companies to provide their employees with all kinds of leave (i.e. family, medical,
      etc.). Currently, the leave management process is painful and inefficient for everyone—company
      leaders struggle to keep up with regulations and processes that change frequently, and the
      employees going on leave are overwhelmed by bureaucracy at an exceptionally important juncture
      in their career. Sparrow transforms this ordinarily tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming
      process into a quick and simple one, saving teams time (20-40 hours per leave) and money (up
      to $25K per leave).
    </p>

    <p>
      Sparrow is a diverse, highly talented and supportive team. Together, we are hardworking,
      collaborative, smart, and humble—after all, we’re solving real problems.
    </p>
