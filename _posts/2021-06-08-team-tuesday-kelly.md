### How did you get to where you are?

After changing my major from petroleum engineering to corporate communications, I worked in support roles in administration and sales. A few roles later, I stepped away from the corporate world, and I started freelancing as a virtual assistant. However, I started to miss the environment of being in a collaborative team, and I wanted to find a company whose mission aligned with my values. This led me to join Sparrow, a place where I have the most supportive team and know that the work we do here improves the quality of life for others every day.

### What is a fun fact about you?

I can’t remember what year this happened, but I was once a part of a Guinness World Record for “Highest number of people dressed as a fruit in one place.” Everyone plus one golden retriever was dressed as bananas. (Yes, really.)

### What are you most excited about for your role in the next 6 months? 

With the fast growth that Sparrow has been experiencing in the last 6 months and with the nature of my role as the assistant to the CEO, I’m excited to see how my role will continue to change and mold to fit the company’s needs. 

### What do you know now about working at Sparrow that you wish you knew on your first day?

It’s okay not to know everything right off the bat! Everyone here is so supportive and helpful. As long as you ask questions and are willing to learn, you’ll ramp up in no time.

### What are you doing this weekend? 

I’m moving from Texas to the Bay Area in a few months. So this weekend, my partner and I are apartment hunting, furniture shopping, and visiting the otters at the Monterey Bay Aquarium!

### What's the farthest you've ever been from home?

I went on an Asia trip two years ago to Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia (my parent’s home country.) It was a great experience being immersed in different cultures, but I do not miss being jet-lagged.
