Kate (they/them) is a member of Sparrow's Customer Operations team. Let's get to know Kate!

## What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow?
The Sparrow team is refreshingly collaborative. We all truly want to make Sparrow a success, and that’s promoted through technology and processes that allow us to work collaboratively.

### Why did you join Sparrow?
I had been searching for a new career opportunity within the healthcare or HR tech field and found Sparrow. I was drawn to how Sparrow is tackling such a difficult and complicated process for both employers and employees taking leave. I have experience in leave management on the HR side and have an understanding of the pain points. Applying to Sparrow felt like a perfect fit with my experience! Plus the interview process from start to finish was fun, engaging and it felt like Sparrow was truly investing in their future success with their search for new team members.

### Fun Facts
* My career path has been in the healthcare industry, Human Resources and Massage Therapy. 
* My favorite music genre is Metal (i.e Igorrr, Dir En Grey, Septicflesh, etc).
* I last binge-watched Lupin and Fate: The Winx Saga. I’m a huge fan of supernatural dramas (no matter how cheesy), mysteries and action packed shows.

### COVID Hobbies
I have tried and failed at two cooking experiments: making fermented slaw and gluten free bread! I generally do alright at cooking but those two have become my arch nemesis. Also, everyone should have an arch nemesis!
