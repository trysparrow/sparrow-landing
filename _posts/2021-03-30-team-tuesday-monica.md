### How did you get to where you are?

My background is in customer support and account management. I got my start in the customer facing world by doing academic fundraising cold calls in college! I’ve worked in a lot of different industries ranging from health insurance to financial tech to mobile ticketing for public transport. I joined Sparrow because I wanted to help manage the leave process on the employee’s behalf so they can focus on navigating large life transitions. 

### What is a fun fact about you?

A fun fact about me is that I still hold the mile record at my high school but I didn’t find out until 10 years later.

### What did your team do to support you in your first month?

My team scheduled frequent video check-ins throughout the day during the first few weeks at Sparrow. This was really helpful because it was great to get face time with my new colleagues and also have a place to get questions answered throughout the day. 

### What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow?

My favorite part of working at Sparrow is the team. We are all extremely collaborative. The team is always willing to jump on a video call to talk something through or help with crafting a difficult email. 

## What are you doing this weekend?

I just moved to a new apartment so continuing to unpack, decorate and get settled. I love going for runs around the neighborhood or for a hike in Forest Park with my dog Juice. 

### What’s the last show you binge-watched?

I’ve been binge-watching older seasons of Survivor. It’s an entertaining escape while not being able to travel!
