### How did you get to where you are?

Happenchance and impromptu decisions. From Malaysia to Singapore to Minnesota to SF Bay Area and now Knoxville, TN  -- nothing was planned. Similarly, I would never have predicted my transition from nonprofit accounting, disaster response, philanthropic consulting, coral aquaculture, lead/data tech to leave management. All that said, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to cross industries and geographies. 

### What is a fun fact about you?

My partner and I are somewhat obsessed with marine life. We enjoy scuba diving, learning marine biology, growing coral and maintaining saltwater aquariums. 

### Why did you join Sparrow?

I was inspired by Deborah, Sparrow’s CEO and founder. Also, I was very intrigued by the gap that Sparrow was addressing and how it would provide a service to help companies and employees in any industry and any walk of life.   

### What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow?

My favorite part is the team and how collaborative it is. Our team is very diverse and everyone strives to improve so that we can provide the best service possible to help our clients and their employees. 

### What are you most excited about for your role in the next 6 months?

I’m excited for some internal operational improvements and some new products/services that Sparrow plans to roll out! 

### Have you picked up any hobbies since COVID started?

Flatwater Paddling -- My partner and I can be away from the crowd in the quiet waterways to enjoy nature.

### What's the farthest you've ever been from home?

In the Bornean jungle surrounded by former headhunters in their village.
