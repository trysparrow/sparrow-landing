### How did you get to where you are?

I’ve always been drawn to mission-driven organizations. Previously, I worked in the nonprofit sector to raise funds and public awareness for numerous organizations throughout the Bay Area. I enjoyed my work, but I knew that I wanted to take another step in my career. I joined Sparrow because I believe in the work that we do, because I love our start up culture, and because every day is a fun challenge. 

### What is a fun fact about you?

My plant collection has tripled since COVID started! Before COVID, I had a rubber tree and a snake plant. Since then, I have acquired a pitcher plant, a bonsai tree, a ginseng tree, a lemon tree, a fiddle leaf fig tree, and a few air plants. 

### What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow?

I get to work with the best people! My favorite part of my week is Team Time, where I get to have lunch with my teammates, catch up on life, and spend time together. 

### What are you most excited about for your role in the next 6 months? 

So much can change in 6 months. I am excited to expand into new parts of the world and to see our team grow.

### What’s the last show you binge-watched?

The Great British Baking Show. This is the perfect show for anyone who wants to escape into a warmhearted world full of scones, tea cakes, and puff pastries. It’s a must watch! 

### Have you picked up any hobbies since COVID started? 

I have finally had the opportunity to check some books off of my reading list. First and foremost, I have been reading the Game of Thrones books.
