The last few weeks have been very challenging for employers trying to manage the COVID-19 crisis. For employers who are concerned about the economic impact of the epidemic, or who are simply looking for ways to support their employees during this time, the new Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), passed by Congress and signed into law on March 18, 2020, provides some answers and relief.

## The new law applies to small and midsize employers

Covered employers include all organizations with fewer than 500 employees, although employers with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt if compliance would jeopardize the business’s viability. Full-time and part-time workers are eligible for paid leave under the law, as long as they have been with the organization for at least 30 days.

## How it helps employers and employees

Under the law, employees are entitled to take two weeks paid time off from work as Emergency Paid Sick Leave, if they are ill or quarantined due to COVID-19, or if they are caring for someone who is. The Paid Sick Leave amount for employees who are ill or quarantined is 100% of their regular wages, capped at $511 per day or a max total of $5,110. Employees taking care-related leaves will be entitled to two-thirds of regular wages, capped at $200 per day or a max total of $2,000. 

Employees are also entitled to take up to twelve weeks off as Emergency Family Leave if they are unable to work because they are caring for their child whose school or daycare has closed due to COVID-19. The first 10 days are unpaid but employees can use their accrued sick or vacation time. After the unpaid period, employees are eligible to receive two-thirds of the employee’s regular wages, capped at $200 per day or a max total of $10,000.

Employers can recoup 100% of the costs of these leave payments by deducting the dollar amount from their withheld employment and payroll taxes on a quarterly basis. In some circumstances, they can even recoup costs for their contribution to the employee’s health insurance during the employee’s leave.
