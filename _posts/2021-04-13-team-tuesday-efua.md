### How did you get to where you are?

I have always loved technology and how it can be used to alleviate human pain-points. That being said, I returned from living overseas about 2 years ago and shortly after, became a caregiver. Needless to say, all things leave and the tediousness of the process was fresh on my mind. It is no surprise that when I came across Sparrow and saw what they did and stood for, sending in my application was a no brainer.

### What is a fun fact about you?

I’ve lived in 6 different countries so asking me where I’m from is a loaded question

### Why did you join Sparrow?

I joined Sparrow because I believe in what they stand for. It is very satisfying going to work every day knowing that I am literally helping to make someone’s life a little easier. 

### What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow?

Hands down, without a doubt, the team! We have a very supportive, diverse, and fun team at Sparrow.

### What’s the last show you binge-watched?

The Queen’s Gambit. It has done nothing for my chess skills, unfortunately!

### What are you most proud of in the last year?

In the past year, I also started a Master’s in Computer Science. I’m proud of the fact that somehow, not sure how, I’m still standing. :D
