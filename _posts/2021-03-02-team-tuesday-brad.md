Brad (he/him) is a member of Sparrow's Customer Operations team. Let's get to know Brad!

### How did you get to where you are?

After working for a super large company based outside of the US, followed by an established company with only a few full time employees, I was looking for something new. Sparrow was a great fit because the company is growing quickly, meaning there is always something to do which keeps me on my toes every day.

### What is a fun fact about you?

One of my hobbies is photography and birding. I have traveled around the US and to Costa Rica (3 times) to photograph different species. For me it is all in the search and the enjoyment of being outdoors! 

### Why did you join Sparrow?

I joined Sparrow because the company serves a great purpose in people’s lives by relieving stress. Because the leave of absence process is difficult to manage for new parents and those who are stepping away from work to care for themselves or their family members, taking leave can also mean not returning to work in the long term. I saw this process unfold at a prior company and wished I could have helped.

### What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow? 
The biggest thing for me is the people. My team HAGGAI4hibachi-perfuseand the others that I interact with daily bring a smile to my face all the time and make the day super enjoyable.

### What are you doing this weekend? 
This weekend I am headed to Tahoe to go skiing! In general, I try to get outside as much as possible. If snow isn’t available, you’ll probably find me on the trail with my wife and dog or riding the East Bay hills on my bike. 

### Have you picked up any hobbies since COVID started? 
Since COVID began, we added a puppy to our home. While he doesn’t look (or sound) like a puppy anymore he definitely still acts like one! So my new hobby is dog training!
