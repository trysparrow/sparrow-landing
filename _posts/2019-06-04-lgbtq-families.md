## "Love Wins"

In 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across America, ruling that marriage was a right, no matter one’s gender or sexual orientation. For many, this ruling not only carried with it the celebration of love after decades of activism but also the possibility of new legal benefits.

For numerous LGBTQ+ families, navigating the legal waters of paid family leave post-2015 has not been a breeze. Many companies still operate under policies that were originally designed for cisgendered, straight couples. When paid leave is provided it’s usually through short-term disability policies which only cover the birth parent, leaving adoptive parents out.


## Nuclear Families vs. Chosen Families

Under the United States Department of Labor, there is the Family and Medical Leave Act [FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28B.htm) which all parents rely on for job security up to 12 weeks after birth or adoption, but the FMLA doesn’t guarantee paid leave—some regulations that make it harder to qualify for paid leave are:



* You work at a company with more than 50 employees within 75 miles of your workplace
* You have worked there for at least 12 months
* You have worked there a minimum of 1,250 hours in the past year


[40% of employees do <b>not</b> meet all criteria for coverage under FMLA.](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/survey/FMLA_Survey_factsheet.pdf)


There is a long-standing misconception surrounding non-nuclear family structures that, if someone is not a genetic parent to their child, that they are not technically parents and therefore  are undeserving of parental leave coverage.


<blockquote style="margin:auto;"><br />
  <table style="margin:auto;">
    <tr>
      <td><b>
        “I had people at work even tell me I didn't deserve to be tired because I wasn't his 'real' mom [....] Genetics don't mean shit. <b>Biological or not, every parent deserves time off to bond with their kiddos</b>.”<br />
        —Trae, queer/genderqueer, therapist (Pennsylvania)<br />
      </b></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

The problematic gendered language surrounding family leave has also negatively impacted gay dads, who are forced to use sick time or vacation days—unpaid time off—to care for their new child. While parental leave is often available for men, it’s difficult for many to take it for fear of being looked down on by their superiors or facing [negative career consequences](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/12/the-risky-business-of-paternity-leave/282688/).


According to the Center for American Progress (CAP), for more and more families in the US, [chosen families are becoming the norm, not the exception](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2017/10/26135206/UnmetCaregivingNeed-brief.pdf). CAP concluded that paid leave is a necessity that would greatly benefit two marginalized communities—LGBTQ+ people ([especially those who live at or below the poverty line](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/02/even-after-gay-marriage-many-queer-families-cant-access-leave.html)) and those with disabilities.   



A recent [study](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-families-poised-dramatic-growth-national-survey-finds-n968776) has found that LGBTQ+ families will see a dramatic growth in the near future, with 63% of LGBTQ+ millennials considering having children or expanding their families. With this upcoming surge in diverse families in the workplace, employers must seriously consider the language surrounding their leave policies and the benefits they currently offer. Many LGBTQ+ organizations are [lobbying for more inclusive language](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-families-poised-dramatic-growth-national-survey-finds-n968776) to expand the definition of a family. If a company’s policies are exclusionary and their benefits limited or lackluster, these diverse employees will be [less likely to return to work after their leave](https://www.workingmother.com/third-moms-contemplate-quitting-when-they-return-to-work-even-after-long-maternity-leave).

## The Bottom Line

As diverse families become more common in the workplace, employers must re-examine their policies surrounding paid family leave and what the contemporary definition of ‘family’ has become.
