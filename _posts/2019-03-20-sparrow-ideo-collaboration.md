  A few weeks ago, IDEO invited Sparrow to collaborate on designing our marketing materials. We bundled in on a rainy day by the Bay Bridge on Embarcadero and sprinted on some great ideas. In fact, IDEO helped us draft our new landing page that we launched last week! We're thankful we got to work with such vibrant, creative and compassionate folks.
