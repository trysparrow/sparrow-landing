### How did you get to where you are?

I am constantly observing the way things around me work and why. This made process-oriented work a natural fit for me! I have achieved operational success in a variety of roles including being President of my student organization and its property's housing corporation and leading projects within startups. The Internal Operations role at Sparrow was the perfect opportunity to exercise my operational mindset while offering the invitation to grow with the challenges that a dynamic environment can bring with it.

### What is a fun fact about you?

Orcas are one of my favorite animals! They are also one of the reasons that I am terrified of the ocean.

### Why did you join Sparrow?

I joined Sparrow because I saw the opportunity to do the two things I love most: building out processes and making life easier for those around me. I am able to make tangible impacts through my work and it shows with every newly implemented process that makes leave management a more pleasant experience for both our customers and my teammates!

### What is your favorite part of working at Sparrow?

The best part about working at Sparrow is the culture. Our team is very empathetic, which makes each day's accomplishments feel that much more satisfying knowing how much time and stress we have saved our customers on leave.

### What are you doing this weekend? 

My family just recently adopted a puppy and she is quite the handful! I will be spending my weekend chasing Danni around the yard and keeping pinecone eating to a minimum.

### What is the last show that you binge-watched?

Stargate: SG-1. The mix of sci-fi, links to ancient human history, and of course humor have made this show quickly become one of my favorites!
