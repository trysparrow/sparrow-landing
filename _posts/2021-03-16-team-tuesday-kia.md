### How did you get to where you are?

I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left college, so I began waiting tables and trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. One night I was watching MTV True Life and they showed a man travelling to Thailand to become a professional Muay Thai fighter. I had never heard of Muay Thai but became obsessed with it and I immediately began taking classes. My passion for the sport grew and within six months I made the decision that I was going to go train in Thailand for 3 months.

I learned so much about myself and what I wanted to do with my life on that trip that went beyond becoming a professional Muay Thai fighter. I found a passion for photography, made lifelong friends, and really learned to trust myself and my decisions for my life. When I returned to the states I started my own photography business. Soon, I took up graphic design and did some web development for local Atlanta businesses.

When I grew tired of that I took a contract role for a company in Atlanta, which allowed me to work with West Point, Disney, Boyscouts of America, and some other cool companies. While doing all of that, I also worked for a San Francisco-based startup for 6 years until the company downsized. Soon, I realized I really missed working for a startup and began looking to join another team. When I heard about Sparrow from a friend, I jumped at the opportunity to interview!

### What is a fun fact about you?

Every winter my school would send us to Anzere, Switzerland for ski school. During the week we would learn new skills and have small competitions. Our ski instructors were amazing, patient, and knowledgeable. They really left a great impression on me, and for some time in my youth I seriously considered becoming a ski instructor. 

### What do you know now about working at Sparrow that you wish you knew on your first day?

It is okay to not be a leave expert on your first day. Between regulations and deadlines, there is a lot to keep track of. Sparrow knows this, so every team member goes through an extensive training and apprenticeship before graduating to maintain their own accounts.

### What are you most excited about for your role in the next 6 months?

Sparrow has been growing quickly since I joined, and recently my responsibilities have transitioned from being great at managing leaves to helping new team members become great at managing leaves. I am excited to develop my skills as a mentor and help my teammates grow.

### What’s the last show you binge-watched?

Lupin on Netflix. It had the perfect mix of action and drama all in an international setting. 

### What's the farthest you've ever been from home?

Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. I got to spend a weekend with a dear friend’s family I met in Thailand. I participated in a monk ordaining ceremony and had a wonderful time visiting the local markets.
