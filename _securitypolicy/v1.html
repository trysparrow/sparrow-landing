<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>Is Sparrow HIPAA compliant?</h2>
    HIPAA applies specifically to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers. Sparrow is authorized to collect information for leave management in accordance with employment law, the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). While HIPAA does not apply to Sparrow’s activities, we take security very seriously and strive to align with the security elements of HIPAA, also known as the Federal Privacy Act, that require reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in order to protect your employees’ data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Is Sparrow CCPA compliant?</h2>
    The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a data privacy law that regulates businesses that collect or sell California consumer data and satisfies one of the following thresholds: (1) generates $25 million or more in annual revenue; or (2) possesses personal data for more than 50,000 “consumers, households, or devices;” or (3) earns more than half of its annual revenue selling consumers’ personal data. While Sparrow does not meet these entity requirements, we consider your employees’ privacy rights to be fundamental to our relationship. In that respect, we do not sell information to third parties, we explain what information is collected, we give the employee access to their information, and we do not discriminate against them when they choose to exercise their privacy rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Is Sparrow GDPR compliant?</h2>
    Sparrow is based in the State of California in the United States. All of Sparrow’s operations, including data control and processing is located within the United States. Sparrow does not target or profile data subjects within the European Union. Therefore, Sparrow’s activities fall outside the scope of Union law and Sparrow is not required to comply with GDPR. That said, we strive to meet the accountability principles of GDPR:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
      <li>To process data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner;</li>
      <li>To collect data for a specific, legitimate purpose and to not further process it in a manner incompatible with that purpose;</li>
      <li>To only collect what is necessary for the purpose of the processing;</li>
      <li>To maintain accuracy of the data;</li>
      <li>To minimize the retention of data with personally identifiable information; and</li>
      <li>To process in a manner to ensure appropriate security.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
