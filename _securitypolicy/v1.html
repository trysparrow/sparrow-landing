<b>Secure connections.</b>
<p>Sparrow forces HTTPS connections on our public website and client dashboards, as well as our internal dashboards used by our Product Specialists and Engineers.</p>

<b>How do we handle encryption?</b>
<p>Highly-sensitive PII fields such as social security numbers are encrypted at rest within the database with decryption keys not stored in the database â€” only in memory.</p>

<b>What is our policy on data retention?</b>
<p>We retain all data on active clients and reserve a 90-day retention window after ending a contract with a client for bookkeeping and internal assessment purposes. After the 90-day retention period we delete all PII from our databases. Records may be kept in offline archived copies of databases.</p>

<b>Comprehensive Data Backups.</b>
<p>We <b>back up our database fully once a day</b>, and <b>log all field level changes</b> to enable migrations to specific intra-day states.</p>

<b>Who has access to your data?</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Your Employees</b> are only able to access their own information and select public fields and uploads their organizations allow for.</li>
  <li><b>Your Organization Admins</b> are only allowed access to certain non-PII, essential fields about employees. Our goal is not to expose any private or unnecessary information about employees to organizations without cause. (including but not limited to personal addresses, social security numbers of employees and children, personal non-work income, etc.).</li>
  <li><b>Sparrow Product Specialists</b> have monitored access to information on employees for organizations that they partner with.</li>
  <li><b>Sparrow Engineers</b> have the same privileges as product specialists, and are subject to the same monitored access of data ingress and egress.</li>
  <li>All access to the platform is done using Sparrow corporate devices that have remote deletion capabilities.</li>
</ul>
