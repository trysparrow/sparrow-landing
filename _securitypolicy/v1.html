<b>Security Awareness Training</b>
<p>Your security is of the utmost importance to us, and the Sparrow team has security awareness deeply embedded in our team culture and training. Each Sparrow team member is regularly trained on effective security policies, secure authentication, safe handling of sensitive data, as well as  avoiding social engineering and unintentional data exposure.</p>

<b>Governance</b>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are recently developed regulations with stringent data protection and privacy standards. Sparrow cares about your data protection and privacy and takes the extra steps to meet the requirements of the GDPR and the CCPA. However, we are not mandated to meet either of these regulations for the following reasons:</p>
<p>GDPR. The GDPR regulates data controllers that collect or process personal data from European Union residents. Because Sparrow currently only collects and processes personal data within the United States, it is not regulated under GDPR.</p>
<p>CCPA. For-profit legal entities doing business in California must comply with the CCPA if they have $25 million or more of annual revenue; or possess the personal data of more than 50,000 “consumers, households or devices”; or earn more than half of its annual revenue selling consumers’ personal data. Because Sparrow <b>does not sell</b> our clients’ employee personal data, nor do we have the revenue or personal data volume, we do not meet the CCPA requirements to mandate compliance.</p>

<b>Secure connections.</b>
<p>Sparrow forces HTTPS connections on our public website and client dashboards, as well as our internal dashboards used by our Product Specialists and Engineers.</p>

<b>Encryption</b>
<p>Highly-sensitive PII fields (i.e. drivers’ license number, social security number) are encrypted at rest within the database with decryption keys stored separately from the database.</p>

<b>Data retention policy</b>
<p>We typically retain all data on active clients and reserve a 90-day retention window after ending a contract with a client for bookkeeping and internal assessment purposes. Deleted data may remain in backups of databases.</p>

<b>Comprehensive Data Backup</b>
<p>We backup our database fully once a day, and log field level changes to enable migrations to specific intra-day states.</p>

<b>Data Access</b>
<ul>
  <li>Client employees added to the Sparrow dashboard are only authorized to see their own data and data shared with them by the company or Sparrow product specialists.</li>
  <li>Client organizations are, through the Sparrow dashboard, only  authorized to see their own data, certain authorized employee data, and data shared with them by Sparrow product specialists.</li>
  <li>Sparrow product specialists have access to organization and employee data.</li>
  <li>Only lead Sparrow software engineers have access to all data on the dashboard, such being necessary for them to perform maintenance and administration.</li>
  <li>Sparrow employees access the platform using Sparrow corporate devices that are encrypted and have remote deletion capabilities among other security controls.</li>
</ul>

<p>The details of our security implementation may evolve to address current threats, changes in standards, and our business environment, so if you have any questions about our most recent implementation of these policies, please direct your inquiry to security@trysparrow.com.</p>
