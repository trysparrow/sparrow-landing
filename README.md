Authors and everyone with a name and photo are listed in _data\/people.yml by the first three letters of their given name and first letter of their surname. For instance, our benevolent overlord would be debh. I don't know why I made this so complicated.

 - \/banners: Banners and post preview pictures
 - \/faces: Headshots of folks in people.yml
 - \/figures: Diagrams and stuff to illustrate stuff
 - \/world: People doing stuff in the world (I'm bad at directory names)


New blog posts should copy and fill in the front matter from old ones. Preview is optional and will default to banner.
